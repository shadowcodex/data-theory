# Algorithms

Various algorithms developed for different purposes. Some are standard, some are not. 

## Current list of Algorithms

* isPrime ![status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-completed-brightgreen.svg)
  * `dt.isPrime(integer);`
  * *This checks to see if the number passed to it is prime.*

* continuingFraction ![status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-completed-brightgreen.svg)
  * decimal `dt.continuingFraction.decimal([array]);`
    * *This takes an array of integers and returns the results of running them as a continuing fraction. Returns as decimal number.*
  * reducedFraction `dt.continuingFraction.reducedFraction([array]);`
    * *This takes an array of integers and returns the results of running them as a continuing fraction. Returns as a reduced fraction number.*
  * product `dt.continuingFraction.product([array]);`
    * *This takes an array of integers and returns the results of running them as a continuing fraction. Returns the product of the numerator and the denominator of the reduced fraction.*
