  * decimal
    * *This takes an array of integers and returns the results of running them as a continuing fraction. Returns as decimal number.*
  * reducedFraction
    * *This takes an array of integers and returns the results of running them as a continuing fraction. Returns as a reduced fraction number.*
  * product
    * *This takes an array of integers and returns the results of running them as a continuing fraction. Returns the product of the numerator and the denominator of the reduced fraction.*
