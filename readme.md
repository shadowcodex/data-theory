# Data Theory

This is a collection of Data Science and Theory implementations. I know there are a lot of 
things out there that do these same things, but I wanted to create my own library
for this. This helps me learn, and gives another resource for others to learn with. 
I chose to do this in javascript because that is the language I enjoy
the most.

I am also going to make this available on npm so people may include these 
sorts and data algorithms into their projects easily.

If you have things you would like to add to contribute, please do via a 
Pull Request. Issues? File them in issues.

This will be discussed more over at [http://learning.10ksoft.com](http://learning.10ksoft.com) 
once I finish a base project. I'll write up a full tutorial and article 
about the sorting algorithms.
